	<a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanities</a> is a card game that gets as awkward and	despicable as you and your friends can make it. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	The game is simple. Each round, the card tzar will read out one black card, and everyone else will try to match with their funniest white card.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><h2>Example</h2></li>
	<li class="message rounded">
	For example, say the following is a card that the tzar has
	read aloud the black card. The other players would then play
	white cards accordingly, and after they are all submitted, the
	tzar would then pick the card they think is the funniest.

	For here, the most despicable answer is probably "Necrophilia".

	<li class="message rounded">

	then invite your friends to play with you just by giving the
